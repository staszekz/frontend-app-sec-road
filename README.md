# My Road to Becoming an AppSec Frontend Dev with AI Support

**Current role:** Mid-level Frontend Developer (5–6 years exp, React/Next.js/JS/TS)  
**Goal:** Evolve into a **secure frontend developer / AppSec specialist** who uses AI tools (Cursor, Claude, GPT) to write faster *and* more securely.  
**Why?** AI is automating routine frontend work → the future belongs to devs who understand security (OWASP, web vulns) and can guide / verify AI-generated code.

**Start date:** January 2026  
**Pace:** 2–4 hours per week (realistic side learning)  
**Location vibe:** Chapel Hill, NC → aiming for Research Triangle tech / cyber jobs

### What I'm learning right now

**Phase 1 – Client-Side Security Basics**  
Main resource: PortSwigger Web Security Academy  
🔗 https://portswigger.net/web-security  

Focus labs (in order):
- Cross-site Scripting (XSS) – reflected, stored, DOM-based
- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
- CORS misconfigurations
- Clickjacking

After each lab → note how to prevent in React/Next.js + test prompt with AI

**Phase 2 – OWASP Top 10:2025**  
🔗 https://owasp.org/Top10/2025/  
Reading one category per week + cheat sheets  
🔗 https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/

Priority:
- A01 Broken Access Control
- A02 Security Misconfiguration
- A04 Cryptographic Failures
- Secure Headers, CSP, XSS Prevention

**Phase 3 – Prompt Engineering for Secure Coding**  
🔗 https://www.promptingguide.ai/  


####

**Mini-project idea**  
Build a simple lofi beats player web app (my own music) with:
- CSP headers
- Input sanitization (DOMPurify)
- Secure auth flow (if added)
- npm audit + dependency checks
